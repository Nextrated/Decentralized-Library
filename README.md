## What is MetaFiles ?

Metafiles is a decentralized library that allows users upload and share files. These files can be set to public or private depending on the user preferences during upload. Public files can be shared via the link generated for it while private files can grant view access to specified addresses selected by the user. Private files and shared files are not accessible to other people except tin the case of sharing while public files are accessible to everyone on the DAPP. 
A user can also search for files by CID or by file name. 
Users can preview files as well as download them locally based on their choice. Share link option is available for public files while share access is available for private files.
